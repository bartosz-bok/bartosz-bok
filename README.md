Hi there!

I am finishing my Master's studies in Automation and Robotics at Warsaw University of Technology. I am fascinated by using machine learning and artificial intelligence in robotics.  :robot:

Currently, I want to constantly develop the methods I have learned and start using them in Data Science solutions. :bar_chart:
